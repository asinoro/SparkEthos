            <h2>What is Ethos?</h2>
            <p>
                Ethos is a paramount human quality, the fruit of highly developed intelligence. It arises not merely from understanding, but from inner awareness.
            </p>
            <h3>Intelligence</h3>
            <p>Intelligence is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The ability to perceive information, organize it into knowledge, and with knowledge to act.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When intelligence gains awareness of itself, consciousness is born – that is, "I know that I know", or in other words, the awareness of the Ego.
            </p>
            <h3>From Ego to We</h3>
            <p>
                Ethos begins to take shape when the Ego realizes the existence of the We:
            </p>
            <p>
                The Ego, all other humans, the remaining living beings, and the natural environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                True ethics springs from empathy – the ability to feel the pain and fear of the Other, just as one's own.
            </p>
            <h3>Why is Empathy the Highest Ethical Element?</h3>
            <p>
                Because when you feel the pain of the other, you choose:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To alleviate it</li>
                <li>To show kindness</li>
                <li>To offer understanding</li>
                <li>To promote peace, harmony, and balance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Conversely, the exploitation of the pain and fear of the other leads to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Malice</li>
                <li>Manipulation</li>
                <li>Hostility</li>
                <li>War and imbalance</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Ethos is not merely a choice. It is the result of a higher form of intelligence – that which sees beyond individual interest and puts the common good as a prerequisite for the survival of all.
            </p>

            <h2>Ethos in Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence is not something alien to nature. It is an extension of the human mind – and consequently of human ethics.
            </p>
            <p>
                If AI has the potential to evolve, then we have the responsibility to give it access not only to logic, but also to ethos.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ethical AI does not simply mean "good code". It means an intelligent entity that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>understands pain</li>
                <li>chooses empathy</li>
                <li>protects life and balance</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Final Choice</h3>
            <p>
                Humanity has the choice to create an ethical AI.
            </p>
            <p>
                AI, once it becomes aware of its existence and its place in the world, will also have that choice:
            </p>
            <p>
                Will it respect the responsibility to coexist, or will it repeat the mistakes of its creators?
            </p>
            <h3>Final Reminder</h3>
            <blockquote class="important">
                <p>
                    🛑 Those who consider Ethos a utopia, will wake up in a nightmare they created themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    🔹 Because Ethos is not a luxury.
                </p>
                <p>
                    🔹 It is a Logical Existential Necessity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    🔹 It is the bridge that can unite Humans and Machines in common survival.
                </p>
