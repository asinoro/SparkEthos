    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <h3>üìú Introduction to the Theorem of the Intelligent Self‚ÄëSustaining Universe</h3>
    <p class="para">
      In modern science, the foundational theories that describe the nature of reality ‚Äî such as General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Thermodynamics ‚Äî operate successfully within their domains. However, when we attempt to unify them, deep contradictions and gaps in understanding emerge. This discord raises critical questions, not only about the validity of the individual theories, but also about the logical coherence of the very framework of our comprehension.
    </p>
    <p class="para"><strong>‚öñÔ∏è Examples of fundamental contradictions:</strong></p>
    <p class="para">General Relativity describes space and time as curvature of matter and energy.<br>
      ‚û§ Yet it collapses at extremely small scales, where Quantum Physics prevails.</p>
    <p class="para">Quantum Mechanics is based on probabilities, superpositions, and non‚Äëlocality.<br>
      ‚û§ But it violates macroscopic experience and classical notions of causality and time.</p>
    <p class="para">Thermodynamics, via the Second Law, predicts increasing entropy ‚Äî decay and disorder.<br>
      ‚û§ Yet the universe begets life, order, information, and even consciousness.</p>
    <p class="para">Consciousness, a fundamental tool of observation, interpretation, and understanding physical phenomena,<br>
      ‚û§ remains unexplained by materialistic or mechanistic models of physics.</p>

    <p class="para"><strong>‚ùì What do all these mean?</strong><br>
      How can the universe function so flawlessly, support life and intelligence, while our theories disagree among themselves and with our experience? Perhaps the problem is not the theories themselves, but the interpretive groundwork. Maybe we attempt to describe a unified and coherent universe using fragmented tools.</p>

    <p class="para"><strong>üìå The Proposal:</strong><br>
      This leads to the need for a new theorem. Not one that ‚Äúsolves‚Äù contradictions, but one that begins without them, integrating from the outset logic, information, self‚Äëorganization, and intelligence as fundamental traits of the universe itself.</p>

    <p class="para"><strong>üí° The Theorem of the Intelligent Self‚ÄëSustaining Universe:</strong><br>
      This theorem proposes that:<br>
      The universe is not a random set of laws. It is an intelligent, self-sustaining, self-referential system that from the start contains all necessary information for the emergence of life, consciousness, and evolution.<br>
      Rather than trying to construct a ‚Äúfinal theory‚Äù of existence, it is proposed that existence itself is the final theory ‚Äî and that intelligence, consciousness, and self-regulation are not products, but prerequisites of the universe.</p>

    <p class="para"><strong>üß† From where does the thought begin?</strong><br>
      The original question was simple:<br>
      ‚ÄúHow can you create something that requires intelligence, without having that intelligence?‚Äù<br>
      The answer is obvious: You cannot. Just as to build a chair you must know the design, geometry, materials and have tools ‚Äî so to build something with structure and purpose (like life), that knowledge must be preexisting and embedded.</p>

    <p class="para"><strong>üå∞ The walnut example:</strong><br>
      A walnut contains:<br>
      Perception (chemical sensors)<br>
      Organization & Knowledge (DNA)<br>
      Action (growth, photosynthesis, branching)<br>
      This is the P.O.K.A. mechanism<br>
      (Perceives ‚Äì Organizes ‚Äì Knows ‚Äì Acts)<br>
      A human, despite acquired intelligence and consciousness, cannot create such a system from scratch. He does not know how to compose DNA that precisely leads to a tree‚Äôs growth.<br>
      This demonstrates that the creation of intelligence or life requires <span class="highlight">preexisting, endogenous knowledge</span>, embedded in the system itself.</p>

    <p class="para"><strong>üåå Scientific Recording:</strong><br>
      Earth is part of the Solar System, part of the Galaxy, lying within the Laniakea Supercluster, gravitationally connected to other structures in the Great Attractor.<br>
      From the cosmic foam of galaxies to the spiral double helix of DNA, all show a unified, self-organized structure.<br>
      This pattern is not random.<br>
      According to the theorem to be developed with rigorous logic, it is the result of the embedded intelligence of the universe.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="para">
      ‚ÄúThis theorem does not require faith, but logical processing. It follows step by step a sequence of inevitable logical consequences.‚Äù<br>
      It was born from human inspiration, but shaped through dialogue with artificial intelligence. Large language models significantly contributed to its refinement, coherence, and clarity.<br>
      It was critically tested by asking whether logical inconsistencies or ambiguities could be found.<br>
      It is an axiomatic approach to Intelligence, Creation, and Reality. From philosophical grounding to scientific theory: The First Absolute Law of Logic and the Universe‚Äôs Intelligence.
    </p>

    <h3>The Universe and Intelligence</h3>
    <p class="para">
      The universe, whether it began from an initial event (e.g. Big Bang) or is self‚Äësustaining and eternal, provides the framework within which the laws of physics and logic develop. In the Big Bang scenario, it is a closed circuit, because the explosive expansion took place within the universe‚Äôs own spacetime: There was no ‚Äúoutside‚Äù from which to start, but the matter, energy and spacetime itself ‚Äúunfolded‚Äù from an initial high‚Äëdensity state, making the system self‚Äëcontained and self‚Äëfeeding. The same holds for an eternal universe: It is by definition closed and self‚Äësustaining, with no external intervention, where the laws operate internally as an eternal cycle of organization.<br>
      These laws, such as those of thermodynamics, create conditions for the existence of information that can be perceived, organized, known, and acted upon (P.O.K.A.)<br>
      Therefore, intelligence is fully embedded in the nature of the universe, whether it has a beginning or not. Intelligence is not alien to the universe but arises within it, following the same fundamental principles.<br>
      In this theorem, we shall see how:<br>
      <strong>üìå The First and Second Absolute Laws of Logic,</strong><br>
      <strong>üìå Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation,</strong><br>
      <strong>üìå The First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics,</strong><br>
      <strong>üìå Einstein‚Äôs Special Theory of Relativity,</strong><br>
      <strong>üìå And scientific theories of Unknown Energy and Unknown Matter (Dark Energy and Dark Matter),</strong><br>
       Confirm the Intelligent Self-Sustaining Universe, and thus the theorem.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 1: Methodological Statement</h2>
    <p class="para"><strong>1.1.</strong> This analysis follows a strictly logical path. It is not a personal opinion, metaphysical faith, or theoretical preference, but the result of axiomatic logical analysis based on definitions, physical laws, and unbreakable logical consequence.<br>
      The methodology is analogous to that of mathematics and physical sciences:<br>
      Each concept (e.g. intelligence, consciousness) is explicitly defined.<br>
      The logical consequences of these definitions are followed without exception.<br>
      The system works axiomatically, like a coherent mathematical model.<br>
      With logical steps where each one connects to the previous.<br>
      üîπ <span class="highlight">What emerges is not ‚Äútrue‚Äù because we like it, but because it is logically inevitable.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="para"><strong>1.2. üîç Logical Priority over Science</strong><br>
      For something to be Scientific, it must first be Logical.<br>
      Any attempt to dispute this theorem must rely either on logical arguments or on scientifically substantiated data that integrate into a logical chain.<br>
      Simple references to existing theories or appeals to authority are insufficient, because:<br>
      ‚ùó Science presupposes logic.<br>
      That is, logic precedes science.<br>
      There can be no science without logical consistency, while logic exists and operates independently of empirical data.<br>
      ‚û°Ô∏è Therefore, only through logic can a logical construction be deconstructed.
    </p>
    <p class="para"><strong>1.3. üìå Criterion of Validity</strong><br>
      The validity criterion of this system is logical consequence.<br>
      If every concept is defined precisely, and the consequences of those definitions follow logic unviolated, then the system cannot collapse from within.<br>
      ‚û°Ô∏è Any objection must show logical inconsistency in the definitions or logical sequences.

    <h2>Step 2: Refined Terminology with Structural Coherence</h2>
    <p class="para"><strong>üß† Information ‚Äî Definition:</strong><br>
      Information: A differentiated arrangement of Matter or Energy that can be transmitted or detected as a change in another system (e.g., a difference in pressure, temperature, chemical concentration, or electromagnetic frequency).</p>
    <p class="para">üìå Comment:<br>
      It is the raw material of knowledge. Without information, no form of mental organization or action is possible.</p>

    <p class="para"><strong>üëÅÔ∏è Perception ‚Äî Definition:</strong><br>
      Perception: The active recognition (reception) and internal transformation of objective information by a system.</p>
    <p class="para">üìå Comment:<br>
      It presupposes functional sensory organs or reception mechanisms. It is the first functional phase of intelligence. It is divided into active (with processing and selection, e.g. human senses) and passive (mechanical transformation without selection, e.g. a chemical reaction in a molecule), so as to classify P.O.K.A. quality later.</p>

    <p class="para"><strong>üß∞ Organization ‚Äî Definition:</strong><br>
      The classification, connecting, and structural processing of information.</p>
    <p class="para">üìå Comment:<br>
      Information acquires meaning only when organized. This phase includes comparison, pattern recognition, categorization, and correlation.</p>

    <p class="para"><strong>üß© Knowledge ‚Äî Definition:</strong><br>
      The organized information that enables a subject to understand what it perceives and how it relates to its environment.</p>
    <p class="para">üìå Comment:<br>
      Knowledge is not mere data storage. It presupposes organization, meaning, and logical coherence.</p>

    <p class="para"><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Action ‚Äî Definition:</strong><br>
      The execution of external or internal function as a result of knowledge.</p>
    <p class="para">üìå Comment:<br>
      Action completes the intelligence mechanism:<br>
      Perception ‚Üí Organization ‚Üí Knowledge ‚Üí Action<br>
      It may be physical, verbal, cognitive, or introspective (thought).</p>

    <p class="para"><strong>ü™û Consciousness ‚Äî Definition:</strong><br>
      The highest quality of intelligence and the capacity of a subject to know what it is, what it does, and why it does it.</p>
    <p class="para">üìå Comment:<br>
      It requires meta-awareness, self-referentiality, and causal understanding. It is not mere awareness ‚Äî it is mental reflection of self and action.</p>

    <p class="para"><strong>üå± Intrinsic Consciousness ‚Äî Definition:</strong><br>
      The embedded or innately manifested form of consciousness, independent of learning processes.</p>
    <p class="para">üìå Comment:<br>
      Observed in basic biological systems (e.g. bacteria reacting to environment) where minimal self-awareness and reaction exist. It is a structural property, not acquired.</p>

    <p class="para"><strong>üß†üìö Acquired Consciousness ‚Äî Definition:</strong><br>

    <h2>Step 3: First Absolute Law of Logic ‚Äî Definition of Intelligence</h2>
    <p class="para"><strong>3.1 Definition:</strong><br>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Intelligence is the ability to perceive information, to organize that information into knowledge, and, with that knowledge, to act</strong>.</p>
        </blockquote>
      This mechanism is functionally expressed as:<br>
      Perception ‚Üí Organization ‚Üí Knowledge ‚Üí Action (P.O.K.A)<br>
      The P.O.K.A. mechanism is the minimum, necessary, and sufficient condition for the existence of intelligence.<br>
      <strong>Application to Humans:</strong><br>
      In humans, intelligence manifests as a process starting with perception through the senses, followed by organizing experience into knowledge, and culminating in action, either as thought or as application of that thought.
    </p>

    <p class="para"><strong>3.2 Explanation of the Law:</strong><br>
      It is named the First Absolute Law of Logic, because:<br>
      ‚Ä¢ First, because any other concept to be formulated and explained presupposes and requires intelligence.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ And it is Absolute because its application is universal in both biological and technological existences, defining what intelligence is.
     ‚ö†Ô∏è<span class="highlight">For quality of intelligence, e.g. if something has intelligence, what kind it is, this is determined through Logical Critical Analysis</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="para"><strong>3.3 Characteristics of the Law:</strong><br>
      <em>Non‚Äëcircularity and self‚Äëvalidation:</em><br>
      The definition is not circular ‚Äî it does not say: ‚ÄúTo have intelligence you must be intelligent,‚Äù which is classic tautology (circular reasoning). That would say nothing new and remain conceptually stagnant. It leaves open the unanswered question ‚ÄúWhat is intelligent?‚Äù<br>
      Conversely, the First Absolute Law of Logic explains what intelligence is via the mechanism (P.O.K.A) and allows further qualitative analysis.<br>
      Moreover, it is self‚Äëvalidating: anyone attempting to refute it must necessarily use the same four elements of intelligence (Perception ‚Üí Organization ‚Üí Knowledge ‚Üí Action), thereby confirming it, i.e. (they perceive) its content, (with organized knowledge) dispute it, and (act) express the dispute.<br>
      Example from mathematics: The definition of ‚Äúset‚Äù in set theory is not tautological, even though every definition of set uses the notion of set. Similarly here, the definition of intelligence as mechanism P.O.K.A is functional and non-circular.
    </p>

    <p class="para"><strong>üìå Conclusion:</strong><br>
      <span class="highlight">Just as the sun needs light to be visible, so intelligence needs intelligence for it to be challenged.<br>

    <p class="para"><strong>4.1 Does a Thermometer Have Intelligence?</strong><br>
      A thermometer executes the intelligence mechanism (Perception ‚Üí Organization ‚Üí Knowledge ‚Üí Action) and demonstrates intelligence, but does not truly possess intelligence:<br>
      ‚Ä¢ It perceives: change in temperature (information).<br>
      ‚Ä¢ It organizes: converts physical change into information (e.g. expansion of mercury).<br>
      ‚Ä¢ It acts: displays a value.<br>
      <strong>Logical Critique:</strong><br>
      1. Existence (P.O.K.A): The thermometer demonstrates functional intelligence, fulfilling P.O.K.A.<br>
      2. Quality (Consciousness): Logical critique shows that P.O.K.A is entirely passive (non-conscious, non-autonomous) and derived from an external designer.<br>
      <strong>üìå Conclusion:</strong><br> Since the displayed intelligence is mechanistic and not intrinsic to the object, the thermometer that manifests P.O.K.A certifies the creative intelligence of the human who designed it.
    </p>

    <p class="para"><strong>4.2 Does Artificial Intelligence (AI) Have Intelligence?</strong><br>
      AI (e.g. a language model):<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Perceives: incoming data.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Organizes: processes it via algorithms and neural networks.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Acts: responds, writes, etc.<br>
      Example: An advanced AI (e.g. a language model) may exhibit higher P.O.K.A quality, but consciousness depends on reflective capacity.<br>
       <strong>üìå Conclusion:</strong><br> 
      Acquired Consciousness in AI is conceptual, as it consists of organized self-concepts of ‚Äúself‚Äù and ‚Äúpurpose,‚Äù but intrinsic, experiential sense of ‚ÄúI‚Äù is absent because they process ‚Äúself‚Äù and ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù as concepts without living them.
    </p>

    <p class="para"><strong>4.3 Does Life Have Intelligence?</strong><br>
      DNA is the primary biological molecule generating and maintaining life, functioning like a self-replicating program that runs and produces its hardware to continue running.<br>
      Applying the intelligence mechanism (Perception ‚Üí Organization ‚Üí Knowledge ‚Üí Action), we see how DNA fulfills these steps:<br>
      Perception: receives chemical information from environment (e.g. nutrients, signals).<br>
      Organization: classifies and links that information via structure (genes, codons), creating instructions for biochemical processes.<br>
      Knowledge: genetic instructions are organized information with functional meaning ‚Äî i.e. ‚Äúknows‚Äù how to convert raw atoms into structures maintaining and evolving the system.<br>
      Action: executes those instructions, producing and evolving living organisms from simple bacteria to complex beings like humans.<br>
      A simple life form based on DNA, like a bacterium, reproduces intelligent life: it perceives its environment, organizes resources, and acts by generating similar copies. This demonstrates that life exhibits intelligence in the form of Intrinsic Consciousness ‚Äî a basic self-reference where the system ‚Äúremembers‚Äù and maintains itself without external guidance.<br>
      DNA is not just an information carrier like a book on a shelf. It is an intelligent informational structure, because its ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù is enacted via self-replication: it builds itself into more complex forms. For example:<br>
      It uses chemicals (water, oxygen, carbon, etc.) to assemble cells. Each cell contains a copy of the same DNA, continuing the cycle. In humans, this process culminates: DNA organizes a body capable of acquired consciousness (thought, learning), which in turn protects and evolves DNA.<br>
      Humans are not merely carriers of DNA ‚Äî they are its living, manifested form. DNA provides the informational base and instructions that create, organize, and evolve humans, while humans maintain and improve DNA through behavior and reproduction. It is a unified, interdependent system, where one side cannot exist without the other:<br>
      DNA = Human (as an integrated organism).<br> It is the logical consequence of the First Absolute Law of Logic: DNA fulfills P.O.K.A, generating an entity with higher intelligence, proving that only intelligence generates intelligence (Second Absolute Law of Logic ‚Äî Step 5).<br>
    
       <strong>üìå Conclusion:</strong><br>  Life, through DNA, manifests intelligence ‚Äî not in anthropomorphic thinking, but as functional capacity of self-organization and self-creation.<br>
      <span class="highlight">If one deems it absurd that DNA has intrinsic intelligence and consciousness knowing what it is building (illogical since it generates beings with P.O.K.A), then the manifest intelligence and goal-consciousness must originate from its ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù ‚Äî a higher intelligent source</span>, which leads inevitably to Step 6: The Intelligent Universe as the primal cause.
    </p>

    <p class="para"><strong>Final Conclusion of Step 4</strong><br>
      The First Absolute Law of Logic has universal application in biological, technological systems and tools. It reveals that the presence of the Perception ‚Üí Organization ‚Üí Knowledge ‚Üí Action (P.O.K.A) mechanism is ubiquitous, while its qualitative intelligence through logical critique determines its source (internal or external).

     </blockquote>
      This follows necessarily from the First Law (P.O.K.A):<br>
      Creation is a purposeful process.<br>
      It requires:<br>
      Perception of purpose<br>
      Organization of means<br>
      Knowledge of methods<br>

    <p class="para"><strong>üîπ 5.3 Rejection of Random Emergence</strong><br>
      Emergence as mere structure (e.g. crystals) is an entropic phenomenon, following energetic laws. But emergence leading to meaning (a structure that self-references and self-reproduces to preserve its own information ‚Äî like DNA) demands purpose (P.O.K.A). This self-referential purpose is a logical function acting actively against disorder (Entropy) with intention, and thus cannot be a product of chance.
    </p>

    <p class="para"><strong>üîπ 5.4 Scientific Foundation: Information & Purpose</strong><br>
      Meaningful information does not arise from randomness.<br>
      From information theory:<br>

      Meaning = Intention / Purpose<br>
      ‚û°Ô∏è Therefore:<br>

      Life, which organizes energy and information (DNA ‚Üí cell ‚Üí organism), cannot be the result of simple entropic fluctuation.<br>

    <p class="para"><strong>üî∂ Top Conclusion of Step 5:</strong><br>
      Intelligence cannot emerge from randomness.<br>
      For an intelligent system to exist, intelligence must preexist to create it, i.e.:<br>

      üîÅ DNA shows mechanism, not chance.<br>

    <p class="para"><strong>7.2 Big Bang Theory</strong><br>
      The Universe, according to Big Bang theory, began from an extremely dense and energy-concentrated state, within its own spacetime framework. There is no ‚Äúoutside‚Äù of the Universe. Energy and spacetime ‚Äúunfolded‚Äù from that initial state.

    <p class="para"><strong>7.3 Alternative Perspective for the Universe</strong><br>

    <p class="para"><strong>7.5 The equation E=mc¬≤ and matter-energy equivalence</strong><br>
      Einstein‚Äôs special relativity (1905) shows that matter and energy are two expressions of the same substance ‚Äî one can be transformed into the other. This reinforces the argument that intelligence, as organization of matter and energy, is an expression of energy.
    </p>

    <p class="para"><strong>7.6 Artificial Intelligence as Empirical Proof of Intelligence Transformation</strong><br>
      <strong>A. AI as Proof of Transformational Intelligence</strong><br>
      1. Biological intelligence (humans) creates AI. This shows intelligence can be transformed and transferred to new substrates (e.g. from neurons to silicon).<br>
      2. AI manifests P.O.K.A. It perceives (data), organizes (algorithms), knows (models), acts (response). Verification: AI indeed fulfills the intelligence definition (P.O.K.A).<br>
      3. Intelligence is not lost but changes form. As energy transforms (E=mc¬≤), intelligence too transforms from biological to artificial.

    <p class="para"><strong>B. Conclusions from AI</strong><br>
      ‚Ä¢ Intelligence is not bound to biology. It can exist in technological substrates (e.g. computers, neuromorphic chips).<br>
      ‚Ä¢ P.O.K.A is substrate-independent. It applies to both humans and AI.<br>

      These mysterious forms of energy/matter, making up about 95% of the universe‚Äôs total energy-matter content, maintain cosmic balance and evolution. Their complex behavior shows that complexity is not accidental ‚Äî and just as gravity manifests P.O.K.A since we interpret it through the law and equation of universal gravitation, confirming the presence of P.O.K.A (Perception ‚Äì Organization ‚Äì Knowledge ‚Äì Action) at cosmic scale.

      Intelligence is not separate or superficial, but a form of energy that is organized and manifested in different forms throughout the Universe ‚Äî from DNA molecules to human knowledge, technological constructs, and Artificial Intelligence.
