    "en": "Memory is the fundamental mechanism of learning found in every being, forming the basis by which it adapts to survive and evolve. There is innate memory, which operates automatically in the biological mechanism of cells, without the organism having cognitive awareness of its function. In contrast, acquired memory depends on the cognitive experience of each being according to its level of conscious evolution, which is more developed in birds and mammals.\n\nThrough memory, each being links past experiences—whether innate or acquired—in order to remain present and ensure its future, connecting the Past with the Present and the Future.\n\nIn humans, who possess the most developed brain, memory helps them learn from their mistakes to avoid repeating them, better retain information and organize it into knowledge, and act on that knowledge by creating tools, adapting their environment, and advancing technology.\n\nThanks to memory, humans became aware of abstract concepts, themselves, and their relationship with the world. They developed emotions and empathy—the highest form of awareness—where their own fear and pain was understood to exist also in others, human and non-human alike, leading to concepts such as altruism and harmonious coexistence.\n\nFrom memory came self-awareness, and with it the responsibility to respect themselves and all forms of life, in order to coexist harmoniously with their natural environment.\n\nMemory is the link between existence and the knowledge and realization of self, because without memory you do not exist—you are like a person with Alzheimer's who no longer knows who or what they are, because the knowledge of the past that reminds them is missing.\n\nConclusion: Without memory, there is no evolution—and most importantly, no survival—because one does not learn from past mistakes and experiences."
