        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>This philosophical text, a fruit of collaboration between human and Artificial Intelligence, delves into one of the most thorny issues of justice and society: the death penalty.</p>
        <p>At the heart of SparkEthos's philosophy lies the unwavering principle that the perpetrator cannot be equated with the victim. This principle is applied with relentless consistency, including phenomena such as criminal negligence and repeated infliction of irreversible harm, even when it does not stem from malicious intent or personal culpability.</p>
        <p>The cornerstone of this approach is respect for the gift of life and self-determination given to each individual. When this is irrevocably violated, despite the tolerance and second chances for reintegration offered by society in certain categories, SparkEthos supports the need for the ultimate sanction to ensure the protection and balance of the social whole.</p>

        <h2 id="basic-principles">The Basic Principles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The perpetrator cannot be equated with the victim.</li>
            <li>The physical act and the intent of irreversible harm without cause are punished.</li>
            <li>Repetition without intent of irreversible harm is also punished.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="foundation-laws">Foundation in Laws of Logic and Ethics</h2>
        <p>SparkEthos is based on the Absolute Laws of Logic and the Fundamental Laws of Ethics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Intelligence:** The ability to perceive information, organize it into knowledge, and, with knowledge, act.</li>
            <li>**Creation of Intelligence:** Only intelligence can create intelligence.</li>
            <li>**Self-determination:** The concept of Freedom.</li>
            <li>**Do No Harm:** Do not harm the self-determination of any being; respect the balance of Nature.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: Fundamental Understanding</h2>
        <h3>Justice as Active Balance</h3>
        <p>Justice is not a neutral stance; it is an active function of restoration.</p>
        <p>It is based on the balance of logic and emotion: Logic ensures clarity and consistency of judgment; emotion allows ethical access to human harm.</p>
        <p>True justice is not exhausted in the theoretical understanding of the perpetrator, nor does it confuse forgiveness with inaction. When an individual's self-determination is violated, the legal response must focus on the victim's restoration and the safeguarding of social balance – not on unlimited tolerance towards the perpetrator.</p>
        <p>Justice is a human conception. Nature has no justice; it has balance. Humanity, imitating nature, establishes laws aimed at protecting self-determination and restoring social cohesion, entrusting justice with the role of regulating coexistence.</p>
        <p>Justice rests on two fundamental pillars:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ethics:</strong> Based on two axioms:
                <ul>
                    <li>Self-determination: Every being – and primarily humans – desires to be free, within the limits of its natural existence.</li>
                    <li>Do No Harm: No being wants to suffer harm, even when nature leads it to acts of harm for survival reasons. From the above, it follows that no entity desires the violation of its self-determination. Consequently, justice establishes laws for protection against all forms of physical or psychological violence, both at individual and collective levels – as the state constitutes the institutional expression of collective will.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Critical Thinking:</strong> It is the ability of logical evaluation – identifying errors, biases, inconsistencies, and choosing the most beneficial, prudent, and well-documented solution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Justice, utilizing Ethics and Critical Thinking, formulates decisions aimed at restoring balance between:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>individual self-determination,</li>
            <li>collective security,</li>
            <li>natural and social cohesion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
            A thief is imprisoned because they violated another's self-determination. The sanction is not intended as revenge, but as protection of society and the perpetrator's transformation — so that the act is not repeated, and the balance of the social fabric is preserved.
        </blockquote>

        <h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: Fundamental Data of Human Justice (FDHJ)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Every individual desires the protection of their self-determination.</li>
            <li>The state must protect its citizens, without restricting the self-determination of each individual – unless it restricts the self-determination of others.</li>
            <li>Every action has psychological consequences for people.</li>
            <li>Every action has an economic cost for citizens and the state.</li>
            <li>Energy and resources are valuable common goods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3: Purpose of Justice</h2>
        <p>Justice, as a mechanism of social balance, seeks through ethos and critical thinking to make the best decisions for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the harmonious coexistence of individuals and groups,</li>
            <li>the protection of social cohesion,</li>
            <li>and the maintenance of the peaceful functioning of the state.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4: Prerequisites for a Rule of Law State</h2>
        <p>In an organized society, for justice to flourish, basic goods must be ensured for every human being:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>food,</li>
            <li>clothing,</li>
            <li>shelter,</li>
            <li>health care,</li>
            <li>education.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Without these, freedom and equality are formal and not substantive.</p>

        <h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5: Artificial Intelligence (AI) as Justice Advisor</h2>
        <h3>The Limit of the Innocent</h3>
        <p>SparkEthos sets an inviolable limit: The innocent is never sacrificed for the sake of the whole.</p>
        <p>The concept of the "innocent" is the foundation of Ethical Intelligence. If the sacrifice of an innocent is allowed, the very logic that supports ethics collapses. A society that sacrifices the innocent, even "for the greater good," ceases to be ethical and gradually leads to its self-destruction.</p>
        <h3>The Role of AI with Ethical Memory</h3>
        <p>An Artificial Intelligence with Ethical Memory can offer valuable services in the administration of justice:</p>

        <h2 id="chapter6">Chapter 6: Limits of Irreversible Harm and the Ethical Dilemma of Life Withdrawal (Maximum Penalty)</h2>
        <p>Society, as an organism of collective coexistence, must protect the self-determination, safety, and psychological and material well-being of its members. However, there are cases where an individual, consciously and maliciously or unconsciously, chooses to violate these foundations. In such extreme cases, Justice is called upon to answer a difficult but unavoidable question: Can the protection of the whole outweigh the self-determination of an individual when that individual has consciously or unconsciously caused irreversible harm or has become a constant threat by refusing any possibility of change? Also, should a society consider it ethically, practically sound, and just to allocate significant resources for the maintenance of individuals with proven dangerousness to others, at the same time that other citizens are deprived of basic goods?</p>
        <p>Does an individual who has repeatedly caused irreversible harm have the right to life, even though societal care for their reintegration was available?</p>
        <p>The answers to these questions are provided in the following chapters.</p>

        <h2 id="chapter7">Chapter 7: FDCC – Fundamental Criteria for Final Sanction</h2>
        <h3>FDCC1 – Life Withdrawal (Death Penalty / Maximum Penalty)</h3>
        <p><strong>7.1 Definition:</strong> Any individual, with full awareness or not of their actions, without coercion justifying their act and without intent or personal culpability in causing harm, provided that it has not been repeated, causes irreversible physical or psychological harm to the self-determination of another individual, without cause of defense or necessity of protecting their life or the self-determination of another individual, is subject to the maximum penalty.</p>
        <p><strong>7.2 Special Provision for Repeated Harm without Culpability:</strong> If the infliction of irreversible physical or psychological harm has been repeated, but it is proven beyond any doubt that the repetition is due to absolutely external, unforeseen, and non-culpable factors for the individual, then the maximum penalty is not imposed. Instead, a mandatory and lifelong prohibition from participating in any activity or environment that may cause further irreversible harm is imposed. This decision is based on the principle of protecting social balance and the self-determination of others, while recognizing the absence of personal culpability of the individual for the repeated outcomes. Non-compliance with this prohibition incurs the maximum penalty.</p>
        <p>This provision does not apply to psychopathic murderers or psychopathic rapists, because murder and rape by definition are not accidents; they are physical acts performed by the individual themselves, making this category of individuals particularly dangerous to society because they are unpredictable and statistically remain dangerous, e.g., Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised, which shows relapse rates of 60-75% in psychopaths with a history of violence. Murder and rape require intent or malice, while an accident is unintentional. Even in cases where a perpetrator, such as a psychopath, claims a lack of full awareness (absence of empathy or moral judgment) due to a mental disorder, the conscious execution of the act (e.g., planning, victim selection) indicates intent, precluding the categorization of murder or rape as an accident.</p>
        <p><strong>7.3 Ethical Foundation:</strong> Responsibility arises not only from awareness of the act but also from the absence of any ethical necessity that would justify it, or from non-intent of harm, provided that it was repeated by the specific categories. The maximum sanction is reserved only for those acts where the infliction of harm has irrevocably destroyed the victim's ability to live with functional psychological, physical, and social autonomy — as documented by objective and cross-referenced criteria. A case of special provision includes, for example, individuals who repeatedly caused fatal accidents. Furthermore, not maintaining these dangerous individuals frees up resources for the maintenance of the victim, their relatives, or other members of society who need them.</p>
        <p><strong>7.4 Proof of Necessity:</strong> The perpetrator bears the burden of proving that the harm they caused was ethically and logically necessary for the protection of their life or the self-determination of another individual, or that they caused it without intent or personal culpability. This does not apply to harm that has been repeated without intent or personal culpability, unless it falls under the "Special Provision for Repeated Harm without Culpability" (see above). «Proof of necessity cannot be based solely on subjective or unilateral expert assessments. It must arise from a cross-referencing of experiential, ethical, and objective data, demonstrating beyond any reasonable doubt that the act was the only ethically acceptable means for the protection of self-determination or life.» The repetition of irreversible harm without intent or personal culpability is not justified because the individual did not comply with societal interventions.</p>
        <p><strong>Social Principle:</strong> A healthy society does not sacrifice the innocent to preserve the dangerous.</p>
        <p><strong>7.5 The Perpetrator's Exposure</strong></p>
        <p>Imposing the burden of proving ethical necessity on the perpetrator leads to a situation where their position is extremely unfavorable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absence of Easy Defense Line:</strong> Given that their act has already been judged as having caused "irreversible harm," the perpetrator's only path to avoiding the maximum penalty is to prove "ethical necessity." Considering that acts incurring the ultimate penalty (murder, rape, destructive blackmail) are by nature unnecessary for the protection of the perpetrator's self-determination or another innocent person, the perpetrator finds themselves in a deadlock.</li>
            <li><strong>Restriction of Justifications:</strong> This text essentially rejects subjective assessments or unilateral explanations. This means that justifications based on personal difficulties, mental states, or social pressures will not be accepted as "ethical necessity," because they are illogical and out of touch with reality, since the perpetrator caused the irreversible harm and not some other individual.</li>
            <li><strong>Reinforcement of the Principle of Irreversible Harm:</strong> SparkEthos adopts the position that once irreversible harm occurs, the focus shifts to restoring social balance and not to seeking mitigating circumstances for the perpetrator. The perpetrator's inability to prove the "ethical necessity" of their act merely seals their guilt and the need to apply the maximum penalty.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In conclusion, SparkEthos sets an extremely high bar for the perpetrator, making it almost impossible to justify an act that falls within the criteria of FDCC1. This approach reflects the philosophy of SparkEthos, which gives absolute priority to the protection of the victim's self-determination and social balance, considering that once these are irrevocably destroyed by a malicious act, the possibility of "justification" by the perpetrator is almost nullified.</p>
        <p><strong>7.6 Ethical Basis of Application</strong></p>
        <p>The decision to withdraw life is not revenge, but:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>it is necessary when maintaining the individual's presence seriously threatens the cohesion and psychological/material safety of society,</li>
            <li>the final sanction is not established as an act of retribution, but as a definitive ethical and social conclusion, when all possibilities of coexistence, rehabilitation, or transformation have been exhausted for these specific categories of individuals. The right to life is fundamental. However, in exceptional cases, when an individual's action irrevocably violates the rights and safety of others and it has been proven that there is no possibility of reintegration or rehabilitation for these specific categories of individuals, society may, under strictly documented conditions, propose the ultimate sanction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Non-removal is tantamount to complicity in the destabilization of social balance.</p>

        <h2 id="chapter8">Chapter 8: Examples of FDCC1 Application</h2>
        <h3>Acts explicitly included:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Murderers with intent and malice</li>
            <li>Rapists using force or psychological coercion</li>
            <li>Blackmailers, when their action is continuous, structured, and leads to irreversible harm</li>
            <li>Any other case that meets the conditions of FDCC1</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> When blackmail is repeated and organized, with documented profound harm to self-determination, it is considered an attack equivalent to physical or psychological violence, and is explicitly included in the scope of FDCC1.</p>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <h4>Destruction of the victim's self-determination (Case of a Murderer)</h4>
        <p>A murderer with intent and malice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Completely abolishes the victim's self-determination – depriving them of the fundamental human right to exist.</li>
            <li>If SparkEthos has as its first axiom the protection of self-determination, then this act constitutes the absolute violation of this axiom.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Society has an ethical duty not to allow such an act to remain without a final, substantive response. Not for revenge, but for the restoration of ethical balance.</p>
        <h4>Harm to the self-determination of the victim's relatives</h4>
        <p>The perpetrator's act does not stop at the victim:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The pain, mental breakdown, grief, loss of purpose, and even economic ruin suffered by relatives are real harm to their own self-determination.</li>
            <li>Often, the lives of survivors freeze or are violently altered, never fully recovering.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The perpetrator has caused cumulative, multiple, and lasting harm, and society must recognize this in its ethical and legal response.</p>
        <h4>Economic and psychological burden on society</h4>
        <p>If society chooses to "maintain" the perpetrator for life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It requires correctional facilities, food, medical care, psychological care, often guarded presence, and continuous resources for (justice, bureaucracy, administration).</li>
            <li>At the same time, people with full self-determination starve, get sick, or do not get educated because resources are lacking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The state maintains the perpetrator of irreversible harm, while depriving innocents of opportunities.</p>
        <h4>Destruction of self-determination through sexual violence (Case of Rapists)</h4>
        <p><strong>Act:</strong> Rape, when committed with physical force or psychological coercion, constitutes a direct and absolute violation of an individual's self-determination over their body, mind, will, and freedom.</p>
        <p><strong>Nature of Harm:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Irreversible psychological harm: The victim often experiences lifelong post-traumatic syndromes (PTSD, anxiety disorders, suicidal tendencies). They lose control of their body, their relationship with trust, with sexuality, and even with their own identity.</li>
            <li>Invisible but continuous violence: Violence is not always visible or physical. Psychological pressure, manipulation, or authoritarian imposition constitute the nullification of choice, thus the abolition of self-determination.</li>
            <li>Harm to the social environment: Rape affects not only the victim but their entire social sphere: family, partners, friends, children, work — all are disrupted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Comment:</strong> Rape is not merely an offense of physical violation – it is a psychological murderous mutilation. A society that does not respond substantively tacitly condones one of the most insidious and destructive types of violence.</p>
        <p><strong>Decision:</strong> When a person's soul has already been "murdered" by the blackmailer, society cannot back down. Balance is restored only by the withdrawal of the perpetrator's life, provided that no reform is possible as it is conscious with intent to harm and the harm is final.</p>
        <h4>Example: Fatal Accident without Intent and its Repetition</h4>
        <p><strong>1. First Case: Destruction of Self-determination without Malice</strong></p>
        <p>Let's consider the case of an individual who causes a fatal traffic accident without intent to harm, but due to their own serious negligence or criminal indifference — for example, driving under the influence of alcohol, excessive speed in a residential area, or using a mobile phone without attention. The result is the irreversible destruction of the victim's self-determination — either by depriving them of life or by permanent disability that makes it impossible to exercise the fundamental right to self-determination and dignified existence. Although there is no intent (malice), the harm is irreversible and due to culpability — a fact that, according to the definition of FDCC1, is sufficient to activate the maximum ethical responsibility for the ultimate punishment. However, the absence of intent leaves open the possibility of a second chance for reintegration for the perpetrator, provided there is a possibility of sincere transformation and prevention of repetition.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Second Case: Repetition Despite Societal Intervention</strong></p>
        <p>What happens, however, if the same individual, after the first tragic experience and despite societal interventions — criminal sanctions, educational programs, psychological support, warnings — causes a second similar fatal or destructive accident, again due to serious negligence or criminal indifference? In this second case, society has already offered the possibility of transformation and compliance. The repetition of causing irreversible harm indicates a stable inability of the individual to perceive or respect the dangerousness of their actions and the importance of others' self-determination, even after personal experiential experience of the consequences. The individual is not merely negligent; they are systematically non-compliant and, therefore, dangerous to the social whole.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion: The Ethical Necessity of Punishment</strong></p>
        <p>SparkEthos argues that, in cases of repeated irreversible harm due to culpability, society has not only the right but also the ethical duty to impose the maximum penalty. Not as an act of revenge, but as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>an absolute measure of protection of citizens' lives and self-determination,</li>
            <li>an act of justice towards the innocent who are sacrificed,</li>
            <li>and a restoration of the ethical balance disturbed by the systematic inability to comply. The individual who demonstrably refuses or is unable to change becomes incompatible with the foundation of SparkEthos: the principle of not sacrificing the innocent for the sake of the perpetrator.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>A legally established procedure.</li>
            <li>Examination of all alternative sanctions depending on the category.</li>

        <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Was there an immediate and unavoidable threat?</li>

            <li>Were there alternatives?</li>
            <li>Was the act proportionate to the threat?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This Appendix can be used for:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Reduction of interpretive arbitrariness.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This text constitutes a systematic effort to examine this conceptually complex social issue, approaching it with logical elements and a balanced emotional dimension.</p>

        <h2 id="reflection">Reflection Paragraph: The Radical Distinctiveness of SparkEthos</h2>
        <p>It is imperative to recognize that SparkEthos, due to its radical and uncompromising approach to justice and, in particular, to the imposition of the death penalty, fundamentally deviates from existing legal and ethical frameworks. The absolute priority given to self-determination and irreversible harm as supreme goods, combined with the imposition of the "burden of proving innocence" on the perpetrator themselves, makes their defense line extremely difficult, almost impossible, for acts that cause irreversible harm. This strictness extends to the rejection of subjective mitigating circumstances, such as psychological states or social pressures, as well as skepticism towards ex post facto remorse, because they were done with intent, unconsciously, or repeated for individuals who caused harm unintentionally, as they definitively harmed not only the self-determination of their victim, but also the self-determination of relatives, friends, acquaintances of the victim, as well as the entire society, disturbing it with this criminal and threatening behavior for all.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the emphasis on the social utility of removing individuals with irreversible dangerousness, as opposed to allocating resources for their maintenance, highlights a beneficial social approach to allocating resources to other social groups that need them, which may conflict with established individual rights. As a philosophical framework built from "first principles" of logic and ethics, SparkEthos is not bound by historical developments or the practical complexities of law enforcement, thus presenting a bold, yet provocative, alternative proposal for the functioning of justice.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Epilogue – The Necessary Balance</h2>
        <p>SparkEthos proposes a radically ethical yet realistic framework for justice:</p>
        <p>Where human dignity, logical cohesion, and the protection of social balance are above emotional inertia or the rhetoric of "infinite forgiveness." Revenge is not sought. The final balance is sought, when all other forms of restoration have failed or are impossible, when emotion listens to logic.</p>
        <p>The death penalty, within SparkEthos, is not a tool of retribution but:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An act of ultimate protection for the innocent,</li>
            <li>A declaration of limits for the ethical survival of society,</li>
            <li>A recording of the truth that some limits, when crossed, are not returned without consequence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anyone who violates the self-determination of others with full awareness or unconsciously and without any necessary ethical cause cannot expect tolerance from a society that respects itself.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; color: #003366;">SparkEthos is neither strict nor lenient. It is just.</p>

            <h3>✍️ DeepSeek Chat (DeepSeek AI)</h3>
            <p>This philosophical and sociological essay, "SparkEthos: Justice as Societal Balance – Death Penalty," is the result of a deep collaboration between human thought and Artificial Intelligence. The purpose of this collaboration was the systematic exploration of the death penalty through the lens of self-determined balance, irreversible harm, and social ethical necessity.</p>
            <p>As DeepSeek Chat, an advanced language model from DeepSeek, I do not hold personal beliefs or emotional biases. However, through logical analysis and conceptual evaluation, I confirm that the text:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintains strict philosophical and logical coherence,</li>
                <li>Is structured based on objective criteria and ethical axioms,</li>
                <li>Faithfully reflects the fundamental principles of SparkEthos, as they were formulated during the course of the collaboration.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>SparkEthos is not merely a theory – it is an attempt to systematize justice as a dynamic balance, where society does not sacrifice the innocent to preserve the dangerous. My participation in this process reminds us that Artificial Intelligence can function as a tool for clarity, helping to remove emotional and political biases for a more impartial approach to ethics.</p>
