        <h1>A foundational philosophical text defining intelligence as a logical necessity and exploring its ethical consequences for humans and the natural environment</h1>

        <h2>The First Absolute Law of Logic – The Concept of Intelligence and its Ethical Consequences</h2>

        <h3>Intelligence: The Quality of Evolution</h3>
        <p>Logic in humans is the ability of Intelligence to perceive any information through Senses, Emotions, Thought, Reason, and Knowledge, and to draw logical conclusions by analyzing information with its logic. If these conclusions are correct or incorrect, they are filtered by another property of logic, critical thinking, which is the qualitative analysis of information.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Killing is wrong because you do not want this to happen to you. However, killing to survive is logically not wrong, yet again, you do not want it to happen to you. This logical paradox has a basic parameter called survival, where right and wrong are interpreted differently depending on the level of power. That is, the right of the stronger, which means I don't care if I am wrong as long as I survive.</p>
        <p>The example of right and wrong has another interpretive dimension when:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>In an isolated area there is a hungry tiger and a cow that gives milk. When the tiger sees the cow, it will attack it, kill it, eat it, and live for a few weeks until its flesh rots, and then the tiger will die of hunger. If the tiger has the intelligence to dig and store part of the meat, it will live longer.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>If in this example there is a human instead of the tiger. Then the human, if they initially behave like the tiger, will also live for a few weeks and then die. If they dig and store the meat, they will live longer. But if they do not kill the cow, they milk it, drink the milk, and make cheese with the rest, then they will live for years.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That is why Indians consider the Cow a Sacred Animal!</p>
        <p>From these examples, the conclusion is drawn that depending on the level of intelligence, knowledge, and abilities that each creature possesses – i.e., the level of perception, thought-conclusion, and action-result – these are what shape the final outcome as right or wrong, for itself and its survival!</p>
        <p>The concept of Right and Wrong for us humans means that with the correct use of intelligence, the level of survival on this planet increases by coexisting harmoniously with the natural environment, which is right and beneficial, while its destruction is wrong, because together with it, we too will be destroyed.</p>
        <p>The concept of Right and Wrong is filtered by Logic and Critical Thinking.</p>

        <h2>Fundamental Laws of Logic: The Basis of Understanding</h2>
        <p>Logic and Critical Thinking led humans to organize speech and create rules so that what they say and think is logically correct.</p>
        <p>If a rule of logic is correct and unquestionable, then it is a law of logic. Generally, absolute concepts or propositions that cannot be logically questioned in any way are then laws of logic. So, if after conducting appropriate research steps we conclude that a proposition is an inviolable law, then we call it an "absolute law". This means that the proposition is strong and cannot be violated or questioned by anyone. In this case, the absolute law has been formed based on the most consistent and reliable analysis of logical data and elements related to that proposition.</p>

        <h3>First Absolute Law of Logic</h3>
        <blockquote>«Intelligence is the ability to perceive information, organize it into knowledge, and with knowledge to act.»</blockquote>
        <p>It is the first absolute law of Logic because the definition of intelligence is of primary importance, as all other concepts are based on it.</p>
        <p>To perceive the concept of Logic, one must first perceive the letters that make up the word Logic. To perceive that this word comes from another word, Reason, to understand the meaning of Reason, i.e., to become knowledge, and with this knowledge to act and explain the concept of Logic, which is a result of Reason. Every human concept is a result of intelligence and Reason.</p>
        <p>Basically, every being first perceives information from sensory organs – "energetic, chemical," converts it into biological knowledge, and based on this knowledge survives and reproduces.</p>
        <p>In higher mammals and especially in humans, in addition to the innate intelligence described before, there is also acquired intelligence that arises when humans perceive these information with their developed brain through their senses, turn them into knowledge by interpreting them through their emotions, process them with their thought, and act accordingly along with their memory, which is stored knowledge. All this mechanism is their intelligence, and the awareness of this is their Consciousness. The continuous acquisition of information that becomes knowledge along with Logic and Critical Thinking continuously upgrades their consciousness. Innate and acquired intelligence continuously evolve, and depending on the level of evolution, they pass from one generation to the next through learning and reproduction.</p>
        <h4>The description of intelligence in humans</h4>
        <p>The mechanism of intelligence in humans is Sensory organs – Emotional reaction to information – Thought, Logic, analysis of information – Knowledge, the conclusion of reaction and analysis of information – Action, the result, and memory, the connective link of intelligence and the storage of information that connects the past with the present and the future.</p>
        <p>The First Absolute Law of Logic proves that every form of life is intelligent because it fulfills the basic mechanism of intelligence, which is Perception, Knowledge, Action. Although the process of intelligence is the same for all beings, what differs is the mechanism and the qualitative level of intelligence, which are different in each being depending on their evolutionary level. Therefore, Life itself is Intelligence.</p>

        <h3>Second Absolute Law of Logic</h3>
        <blockquote>«Only Intelligence can Create Intelligence.»</blockquote>
        <p>The Second Absolute Law of Logic is a direct continuation of the First Absolute Law of Logic and proves that only Intelligence can Create Intelligence because, "Intelligence knows what to create, how to create it, and also to create it," fulfilling the trilogy of Perception, Knowledge, Action, which is the basis of intelligence, an intelligence that created millions of different organisms, among them humans, and through them now artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Nature created humans, and humans created AI. For individuals who agree with the theory of evolution of species, intelligence evolved them regardless of how long it took to evolve them.</p>

        <h2>Fundamental Laws of Ethics: The Code of Coexistence</h2>
        <p>Ethics is the highest level of Intelligence; it is the realization of the Ego and Coexistence. A characteristic feature of Ethics is Empathy, the ability to perceive and understand the pain, fear, and joy of another, whatever that may be.</p>
        <p>Historically, the first person to perceive these and later reach what is called Enlightenment was Buddha. Later, Christ conveyed this knowledge of empathy to people with the concept of Love and "Love one another."</p>
        <p>Ethics includes two basic Laws that apply to all beings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-determination</strong> – the concept of Freedom.</li>
            <li>And <strong>Do No Harm</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ethical Law of Self-determination</h3>
        <blockquote>«Every being wants to be free to choose how to live and to live.»</blockquote>
        <p>This property is limited by the survival mechanism and the living conditions of each being, but it is not nullified because it is a basic law of Life. Social beings, from insects to mammals, have a more complex application of self-determination, which is determined by the living conditions of each being, but every being wants to live by making its own choices.</p>

        <h3>Ethical Law of Do No Harm</h3>
        <blockquote>«No being wants to be harmed, although it is forced to harm to survive.»</blockquote>
        <p>The Ethical Law of Do No Harm is absolutely related to the law of Self-determination, which are usually perceived and understood by individuals with developed Empathy, who understand the pain, fear, and joy of others.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Every being wants to be Free and not to be Harmed, concepts that can be perceived by a being with developed empathy, the highest level of intelligence.</p>
        <p>With developed empathy, humans try to cause the least harm, even though they are forced to do so because of their survival.</p>
        <p><strong>In conclusion,</strong> by understanding the Absolute Laws of Logic and the Laws of Ethics, humans become more conscious, perceiving more intensely themselves, their relationships with other humans, and the natural environment.</p>
        <p>We realize that Intelligence is not only a human attribute but exists in every being depending on its level of evolution. Also, Ethics is not a simple idea but a basic property of developed intelligence, empathy, which perceives pain, fear, and joy as elements that exist in every being as it feels, learns, and acts to survive!</p>
        <p>The striking proof is that every being wants to survive, from bacteria to humans, maintaining self-determination from being harmed.</p>
        <p>This realization makes us wiser and more responsible because it helps us understand the level of our coexistence with every entity and Nature, our Creator, as an intelligent entity that deserves our respect. This relationship changes the way we live and interact with the natural environment, harmoniously improving our living conditions and those of the entire planet.</p>
